### ===PLEASE READ===
[THERE IS A KNOWN BUG THAT CAUSES CERTAIN ANTI-VIRUS TO BREAK POWERSHELL]
If you have an anti-virus, I recommend following the instructions on a Wiki page I will link when I create it. Until then, I do not recommend letting BQ update automatically.


BatchQuest uses Batch to do what it does. It also creates, deletes, and modifies a lot of its own files in order to work correctly. Because of this, it may look malicious to an anti-virus. I promise you that it is not, and you can see all the code here to prove it.

To prevent any issues while playing, please add the BatchQuest folder as an exception.

BatchQuest will never make, delete, or modify files outside of this folder.




### -DISCLAIMER-
This project is no longer under Project SOLIAS. It is now a solo project I will work on myself. Please bear with me on the speed of the story production because of this.  -  BatchQuest is currently early in development. Please do not expect any features to stay, or anything to be complete.


# BatchQuest
A series of Batch Files that make a story game.
