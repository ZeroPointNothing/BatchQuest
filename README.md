# IMPORTANT!
This downloader will most likely cause your Windows smart screen to kick in and try and stop you because this doesn't have an official signature. Click "More Info" and "Run Anyway" to stop this. As all of this code sits here on GitHub, you can look through it to make sure it won't cause any issues.
Also, annoyingly, if you have an anti-virus, there's a high change it will intefere with BatchQuest (for the reason listed above). To prevent this, you should add it as an exception. 


A (series of?) batch file(s) that create a Text Based game.
