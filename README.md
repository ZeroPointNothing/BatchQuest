MESSAGE FOR LOCAL INSTALLS: Please make sure to run BatchQuest.bat when you want to play the game. That is how it is meant to be played.

### -DISCLAIMER-
This project is no longer under Project SOLIAS. It is now a solo project I will work on myself. Please bear with me on the speed of the story production because of this.  -  BatchQuest is currently early in development. Please do not expect any features to stay, or anything to be complete.


# BatchQuest
A series of Batch Files that make a story game.

*Will you delve deep into the depths of Arcallis and find the hidden truths within?*
